                <h2>About </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleepy Owl created a consumer brand with a memorable name, where people drink coffee when they want to stay awake or are feeling too sleepy. Sleepy Owl coffee comes from Chikamagalur, Karnataka. They use 100% Arabica coffee. A cup of coffee is only as good as the beans used to brew it. Curated high quality beans, the right roast, and a fresh grind make Sleepy Owl Special.

            <p>Started by three friends who recognised the gap in the market - the need for good quality coffee at home, made with minimal effort, Sleepy Owl’s vision is to disrupt the at-home coffee industry in India, and give our customers easy access to the best quality coffee.From our Premium Instant Coffee to our classic Cold Brew Packs, we’re constantly innovating and redefining the coffee drinking experience. In 2016, we became the first to introduce India to the concept of Cold Brew Coffee, and have been a proud pioneer in this space.Today, we stand over 5 years strong with a vast product portfolio that includes Cold Brew Packs, Hot Brew Bags, Ready-To-Drink Cold Brew Bottles, Ground Coffee, Premium Instant Coffee and a range of Merchandise.
               Our signature chocolatey and nutty flavour comes from single-origin, Grade-A plantation beans grown at 5300ft in Chikmagalur, Karnataka - some of the best there is around the world. The coffee is freshly roasted in small batches, and sealed immediately for dispatch.Better yet we’re also committed to no more plastic packs. Ever. Our Sustain packs are made with paper, aluminium and absolutely no plastic at all. This makes them just as strong, while being a lot nicer for the planet</p>
